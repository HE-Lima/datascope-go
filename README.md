## ðŸš€ Setup

### 1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the GUI

```bash
python src/gui_test_theme.py
```

### 4. Build as `.exe` (TBA)


## ðŸ›  Team Collaboration Protocol
All modules must be integrated into gui_test_theme.py as test blocks.

Each function/module should print to both the console and GUI output area.

Sections in code are clearly marked (e.g. # GUI Interface, # Intro Splash, etc.).

After testing, notify the project lead for final merging.


## ðŸ“¬ 0 Notes for Observers
You are not required to contribute code.

You are encouraged to review repo structure, test GUI, and comment via GitHub Issues.
